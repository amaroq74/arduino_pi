<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

This is the packet structure. If you want to get more advanced information from connections (such as RSSI) then this is where it lives.
<P>

  /* for packet identification purposes... these should not really be nessesary */
  unsigned int  sAddr64;          /* TRUE / FALSE */

<P>
Most of these fields are fairly self explanatory, however some need attention brought to them
and others need explaining. I will touch on the most important here:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>atCmd</B>

<DD>
This is the 2 character identifier for the AT command response you just recieved.
Of course if you didnt setup an AT connection, you should never see, or try to see data here.
<DT><B>Addr16</B>, <B>Addr64</B> and <B>sAddr64</B>

<DD>
These contain the address of the XBee that you recieved the packet from. You should really know this
because you setup the connection. However remote AT packets will contain both 16 and 64 bit
addresses.
<B>sAddr64</B>

will indicate wether the packet is 16 or 64 bit addressed.
<DT><B>RSSI</B>

<DD>
This is the Recieve Signal Strength Indicator. It is the inverted decibel value.
<P>
printf(&quot;-%ddB\n&quot;,p-&gt;RSSI);
<DT><B>data</B>

<DD>
This is the data you just recieved. Either the AT reponse, or the data from the remote XBee node. Be careful using
<B>printf</B>()

with the
<B>data</B>

as it isn't null terminated. Use
<B>datalen</B>

to determine the length of the data.
<DT><B>datalen</B>

<DD>
Would you be suprised if I told you this is how much data there is?...
